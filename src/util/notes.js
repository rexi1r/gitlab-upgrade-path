All new installs of GitLab will automatically default to PostgreSQL 11. For upgrades of existing GitLab installations, the PostgreSQL version will be automatically upgraded to PostgreSQL 11 if PostgreSQL 9.6 or 10 are detected. However, major PostgreSQL upgrades on installations with High Availability and/or Geo require some manual steps. If GitLab detects that you are using repmgr or Geo, it will ask you to follow the manual upgrade instructions [for HA](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#upgrading-a-gitlab-ha-cluster) or [for Geo](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#upgrading-a-geo-instance); we will not automatically upgrade your PostgreSQL database. For 12.10, if you prefer to upgrade your GitLab version first and upgrade PostgreSQL later, you still have the option to stay on PostgreSQL 9.6 or 10 by disabling the PostgreSQL upgrade before you upgrade GitLab (`sudo touch /etc/gitlab/disable-postgresql-upgrade`). **Note**: There is a known issue when upgrading to 12.10 when using an external PostgreSQL database rather than the Omnibus-packaged database, resulting in the need to take some manual steps. To track this bug and see the workaround refer to the [related issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/5299).","","    Please note that PostgreSQL 9.6 and 10 will be removed in the next version of GitLab (13.0). This means that you will need to upgrade your PostgreSQL database to PostgreSQL 11 before you can upgrade to GitLab 13.0.

Once completed, a security policy bot will be enabled in all projects where a security policy is enforced and will become the author of any scheduled scan execution pipelines.","The introduction of [verification of object storage files in Geo](#geo-verifies-object-storage) results in the detection of orphaned upload records and as a result, you may notice primary checksum failure for some uploads. The most likely cause of these failures is orphaned upload records. Orphaned upload records are a result of the parent record, such as [Design Management](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/design_management.html) or [Vulnerability Report](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/vulnerability_report/), having not been deleted together with the associated upload record leaving behind a parentless upload record. Prior to object storage verification being available, only orphaned upload records related to local storage were detected."," "," In most cases, removing the upload record along with the associated file in object storage is safe and is not a data loss concern. It is recommended that each failure is investigated and confirmed to be obsolete before deletion. "],"16_5":["Geo has changed the workflow for proxying SSH Git pull requests.
